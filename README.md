# Xampp Projects Folders Template v1.0
 Template for easy access to your projects folders.
 
 (Only tested on Xampp for macOS)

Replace content in the htdocs folder with the contents of this repository.
I recommend saving a backup of the original files if you need to use them in the future.

Add your projects in ```/projects```
